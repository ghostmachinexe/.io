                <p><em>Pittsburgh, PA 15243</em></p>
                <p> I am a creative individual currently loooking for employement.
                    My experience is founded around the dedicated hard work it takes to be a musician.
                    I enjoy many elements of what I have learned througout my music education, but am most skilled at and passionate about being a vocalist.
                    I however, have also gained quality skills from working for multiple years as a volunteer while I was a student.
                    I am well known as a interpersonal collaborator among peers and have helped groups I've been in thrive due to my organization and focus.
                    The best quality I have as a future employee is the fact that I am willing and eager to learn any skills required to perform to the best of my ability. </p></td>
